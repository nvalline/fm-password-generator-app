## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS/SCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge presented a couple new aspects that I have not used frequently. The first being copying text to the clipboard and the second was custom styling for range inputs.

### Continued development

I look forward to continue these challenges that provide opportunities to try new and different scripting and styling methods that will further advance my frontend coding skills.
